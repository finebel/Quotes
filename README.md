This project is based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRmaiEPk03Y) by [tundsdev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7AuV86ZjR3YaEdb5USNvWQ): 
Please note that I have implemented some parts slightly different than shown in the tutorial. Furthermore I have added a basic error handling mechanism. If there is something which looks improvable then please donâ€™t hesitate to open a PR.
